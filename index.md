# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone
## Professional Self-Assessment
  I started my computer science journey before pursuing my degree at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  After eight years as an intelligence analyst in the military I decided I wanted a career change and attended a software bootcamp.  At the six-month bootcamp they did not only teach us computer programming languages (JavaScript, Python), they taught us how to approach a development problem and solution it.  The goal was to teach us how to think like developers so we could problem solve even if we didn’t know the language the solution needed to be in.  From there I got my first job as a junior developer, but I could tell quickly something was missing from my tool belt.  I knew how to do program, but I did not know the “why” I was making those decisions; I knew I needed to further my education. 
  
  When I first started SNHU I had roughly a year of experience as a software developer, so naturally I thought it would be a breeze for me.  I had a quick realization that I had to work really hard because I basically knew nothing when talking about computer science.  The knowledge I had coming into the program helped me, but there was a clear difference between the developer I was and the engineer I wanted to be.  Courses like CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle, helped push me to the next level in my career.  In CS-250 we learned the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), why each stage was just as important as the last and how to leverage an agile environment to create a team that was successful. I really liked the outcome of CS-250 because the final paper we had to explain each role in the SDLC and also write out our plan for the structure of our scrum meeting. 
  
  CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming, helped me step out of my comfort zone and into mobile engineering. Here I had to use Java, a language I am not very comfortable with and also Android Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) I knew nothing about.  Being about to go from knowing nothing in the first week to having a functioning mobile application in the eighth week was incredible.  I learned how to isolate my problems, break them down into smaller issues and then start solving each issue.  I started by watching every YouTube video I could on Android Studio and did a “Hello World” project more times than I could count.  Failure because I wasn’t comfortable in the language or did not know an IDE was not an option for me.       
  
  Security is very important in the computer science world because so much of our day to day lives are online, using technology. My CS-410 Reverse Software Engineering introduced me to a layer of security I had not known about or even thought about.  Taking an application and turning it into assembly to find out what it does and to look for possible security threats was an awesome concept I am very happy I learned.  Doing this tactic can help you find things you over looked previously in your code because you are desensitized to your mistakes.  Turning it into assembly can make you think about why your code is doing what it is and can make you catch possible security issues. 
  
  As I worked through my computer science degree, I also held a full-time job as a software developer.  There were many times after coding all day at work that I did not want to even think about school work, but I knew in order to set myself apart from the CRUD developer that I was to the software engineer I wanted to be I had to push through. Being able to see my hard work pay off in this final capstone has been really satisfying and I look forward to continuing my learning of computer science throughout my career.      

## Code Review
Below is the link to my code review of the original artifact where I describe and critically analyze existing code and discuss in detail my plans for enhancement.

## Animal Shelter Enhancements
  The artifact I decided to use for my capstone is from CS-340, Advance Programming Concepts.  The artifact is for animal management for an animal shelter, which is why I decided to name the application Animal Shelter.  Animal Shelter is written in python, has basic CRUD operations and also a dashboard with several different charts to help the user quickly ingest data. I decided to create a full stack application using this artifact in order to meet the enhancement requirements of Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. 
  I chose this artifact because I remember completing it in CS-340 and being very frustrated with how the code was laid out and the fact we were using Jupyter Notebook for the user interface (UI).  I knew I could take the artifact and rewrite it in C# and deliver a technically sound application that demonstrated my ability to implement a solution that met the customer’s needs and accomplished industry-specific goals.
  I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing an entity relationship (ER) diagram. Creating the ER diagram will help other developers be able to quickly pick-up on how the data is connected and how it can be queried.  Breaking the data up from a flat table to multiple tables help make a logical path to create, read, update and delete data.  It will also help to only pull the data you need, which could speed up query and processing times.  Normally, the ER diagram would be used internally on the development team, however, if the customer has a data analyst or a more technical person, I would use the ER diagram to show how we are representing the data to make sure we are getting the relationships correct.

  I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by creating a GitHub project to track what I have left in the application in order to hit minimum viable product (MVP).  I did this to provide the customer with the ability to track issues and see the progress of their application.  The project and issues can be found at https://github.com/jcarter0149/AnimalShelter/projects/1.
  I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by leveraging Entity Framework. I focused on data relationships between the different data entities by building out the classes for each, before the artifact had zero data structures for what a data entity looked like.  I broke down how each entity was related to each other and created the classes to represent that so Entity Framework could map the database correctly with the foreign keys.  Below is an example of the class that connects breed type and rescue type together. When I run a migration in Entity Framework, it will look at the class below and determine that it is a many to many relationship.

  I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by implementing custom filters. I made the assumption the company would be on a domain and would have username and passwords for their employees.  With that being said, I use Window’s authentication to grab the username of the user and store that with the account.  This allows the admins to elevate permissions based on username and prevents the application from having to ask for a password or having to store a password.  I then created a custom filter (see below) to decorate my controller with that will run through an algorithm to check and make sure the user has a role in the system and then turn them away if not.

  I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by implementing domain objects, in order to stop bad data from making it to the data layer.  Shown below is the domain object NotNullOrEmptyString that will check if a string is empty or not and then return a result of either success or failure.  Upon a successful creation of a NotNullOrEmptyString the result will have a value property of the original string value.

I put this to use by refactoring the custom filter to ensure the username Windows passed was not empty or null.  I also changed the parameter of the IsUserAnAdminOrAssistant, to accept the domain object instead of a string. This will ensure that when the data makes it to the data layer (_roleApplicationService in this instance) it is not empty and the database will not throw an exception or return something that is not expected.
