# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone

## Code Review
Below is the link to my code review of the original artifact where I describe and critically analyze existing code and discuss in detail my plans for enhancement.

## Animal Shelter Enhancements
  The artifact I decided to use for my capstone is from CS-340, Advance Programming Concepts.  The artifact is for animal management for an animal shelter, which is why I decided to name the application Animal Shelter.  Animal Shelter is written in python, has basic CRUD operations and also a dashboard with several different charts to help the user quickly ingest data. I decided to create a full stack application using this artifact in order to meet the enhancement requirements of Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. 
  I chose this artifact because I remember completing it in CS-340 and being very frustrated with how the code was laid out and the fact we were using Jupyter Notebook for the user interface (UI).  I knew I could take the artifact and rewrite it in C# and deliver a technically sound application that demonstrated my ability to implement a solution that met the customer’s needs and accomplished industry-specific goals.
  I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing an entity relationship (ER) diagram. Creating the ER diagram will help other developers be able to quickly pick-up on how the data is connected and how it can be queried.  Breaking the data up from a flat table to multiple tables help make a logical path to create, read, update and delete data.  It will also help to only pull the data you need, which could speed up query and processing times.  Normally, the ER diagram would be used internally on the development team, however, if the customer has a data analyst or a more technical person, I would use the ER diagram to show how we are representing the data to make sure we are getting the relationships correct.

  I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science by creating a GitHub project to track what I have left in the application in order to hit minimum viable product (MVP).  I did this to provide the customer with the ability to track issues and see the progress of their application.  The project and issues can be found at https://github.com/jcarter0149/AnimalShelter/projects/1.
  I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by leveraging Entity Framework. I focused on data relationships between the different data entities by building out the classes for each, before the artifact had zero data structures for what a data entity looked like.  I broke down how each entity was related to each other and created the classes to represent that so Entity Framework could map the database correctly with the foreign keys.  Below is an example of the class that connects breed type and rescue type together. When I run a migration in Entity Framework, it will look at the class below and determine that it is a many to many relationship.

  I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by implementing custom filters. I made the assumption the company would be on a domain and would have username and passwords for their employees.  With that being said, I use Window’s authentication to grab the username of the user and store that with the account.  This allows the admins to elevate permissions based on username and prevents the application from having to ask for a password or having to store a password.  I then created a custom filter (see below) to decorate my controller with that will run through an algorithm to check and make sure the user has a role in the system and then turn them away if not.

  I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by implementing domain objects, in order to stop bad data from making it to the data layer.  Shown below is the domain object NotNullOrEmptyString that will check if a string is empty or not and then return a result of either success or failure.  Upon a successful creation of a NotNullOrEmptyString the result will have a value property of the original string value.

I put this to use by refactoring the custom filter to ensure the username Windows passed was not empty or null.  I also changed the parameter of the IsUserAnAdminOrAssistant, to accept the domain object instead of a string. This will ensure that when the data makes it to the data layer (_roleApplicationService in this instance) it is not empty and the database will not throw an exception or return something that is not expected.
